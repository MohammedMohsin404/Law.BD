    question: "What is useState and how does it work in React?",
    answer: `
useState is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components.
It returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.

âœ… Example:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

Every time setCount is called, React re-renders the component with the new value.

    question: "What is the purpose of useEffect in React?",
    answer: `
useEffect is a Hook for handling side effects in React such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or setting subscriptions.

âœ… Example:
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);

The empty dependency array means this effect runs once after the component mounts.

    question: "What is a custom hook in React and when should you use one?",
    answer: `
A custom hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with "use" and that can call other hooks.
You use it to extract and reuse logic across multiple components.

âœ… Example:
useAuth(), useForm(), useTheme()

Custom hooks help make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

    question: "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components. Which one is better?",
    answer: `
ðŸ”¹ Controlled Component: React controls the form input.
<input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />

ðŸ”¹ Uncontrolled Component: Uses a ref to get input value.
<input ref={inputRef} />

âœ… Controlled components are generally preferred because they provide better control and validation.

    question: "Tell us something about useFormStatus() in React.",
    answer: `
useFormStatus is a new hook introduced in React 18 for managing the pending state of a form during submission.

âœ… Itâ€™s useful in frameworks like Next.js with the new App Router.

You can show loaders, disable buttons, or give user feedback while the form is submitting.
